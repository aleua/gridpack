Gridpack
===

Gridpack is either a starter theme or a tool for understanding webpack componenents and perhaps CSS grid. It is based on `_s` (or `underscores`, if you prefer). 


Getting Started
---------------
To install clone or download this repository and `npm install` 

`npm start` will get you up and running

(Optional) Create a file named config.js and provide the correct values for your environment 

Example

```
module.exports = {
    url : 'http://local.wordpress.dev/',
    themeDir : '/wp-content/themes/gridpack/',
    fullPath : 'http://local.wordpress.dev/wp-content/themes/gridpack/',
    ip  : "192.168.50.4"
}
```

Some sample components are include and each have their own colour-code

- `src > compenents > templates > home` is `#FFB200`
- `src > compenents > templates > single` is `#00CED1` 
- `src > compenents > templates > page` is `#d500c9` 
- `src > compenents > parts > footer` is 
- `src > compenents > parts > header` is `#FF0050`

This is very much a work in progress. Contributions will be welcome once the project is at a stable version
